% The paper proposes soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients
% with an adaptively-chosen threshold. The threshold is chosen
% using the SURE (Stein's unbiased estimate of risk) for the
% Soft Thresholding Estimator.  The paper shows that this has
% various optimality properties for mean-squared error estimation.
